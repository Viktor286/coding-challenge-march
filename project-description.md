Dubai to the Stars â€“ The Ultimate Space Travel Experience

The future of travel is here! Imagine Dubai as the worldâ€™s first hub for commercial space travel. Your challenge is to code a platform that allows users to book and manage space station trips, check schedules, compare prices, and even find accommodation in space.

Your Challenge:

Develop a functional prototype of a space travel booking platform with the following features:
Trip Scheduling & Booking: Allow users to choose departure dates, destinations (space stations, lunar hotels, etc.), and seat classes.
Pricing & Packages: Display different travel optionsâ€”luxury cabins, economy shuttles, and VIP zero-gravity experiences.
Accommodation Recommendations: Suggest space hotels or orbital stations based on user preferences.
User Dashboard: A profile page where travelers can manage their bookings, see countdown timers for launch, and get AI-based travel tips.

We focus on the top-notch front-end for web in this project. We're mobile first. We love using design systems. We love SOLID and GRASP principles, as well as TDD and BDD.

We love simple and concise code.

We love good isolation and encapsulation the most of all.

The core tech stack is Next.js 15 + Tailwind 3. In our project we also use: typescript, pnpm, vitest
