# Space Travel Booking Platform ðŸš€ - Technical Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive technical plan for developing the Space Travel Booking Platform ðŸš€. The platform will be built using modern web technologies with a focus on accessibility, performance, and code quality.

## Core Principles

- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout the application
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design optimized for all device sizes
- **Component Isolation**: Well-encapsulated components with clean interfaces
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to SOLID and GRASP principles

## Project Architecture

### Application Structure

- **Monorepo setup** using pnpm workspaces
- **Feature-based folder structure** rather than type-based
- **Core layers**:
    - Presentation (UI components)
    - Application (business logic)
    - Domain (core business entities)
    - Infrastructure (API clients, storage)

### Key Architecture Decisions

- Leverage **Server Components** for static content and improved SEO
- Use **Client Components** for interactive elements
- Implement **Streaming** and **Suspense** for improved loading experience
- Apply **Route Groups** for logical organization
- Use **Parallel Routes** for complex layouts with multiple loading states
- Middleware for authentication and other cross-cutting concerns

### API Data Management

- All website data will be stored in data/ folder in json format

## Design System Implementation

### Atomic Design Methodology

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (Button, Input, Icon)
- **Molecules**: Compound components (SearchBar, FormField)
- **Organisms**: Complex components (CourseCard, AchievementPanel)
- **Templates**: Page layouts with placeholder content
- **Pages**: Complete page compositions

### Design Token System

- Colors (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic)
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing (consistent spacing scale)
- Breakpoints (responsive design breakpoints)
- Animations (durations, easing functions)
- Shadows (elevation levels)

### Tailwind Configuration

- Custom color palette
- Extended typography scale for accessible text sizes
- Custom plugins for complex UI patterns

## 4. Accessibility Implementation

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Strategy

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Screen reader compatibility with ARIA attributes
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Text resizing without breaking layouts

### Specific Accessibility Features

- Skip to content links
- Focus indicators
- Image alt text
- Form error handling
- Reduced motion options
- Proper heading hierarchy

## Responsive Design & Mobile First Approach

### Mobile-First Development

- Base styles targeting mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Utilizing Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Custom media query approach for complex layouts

### Responsive Patterns

- Fluid typography system
- Flexible grid layouts
- Optimized images using Next.js Image component
- Touch-friendly UI elements (min 44Ã—44px touch targets)
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness

### Cross-Platform Considerations

- Platform-specific optimizations
- Device testing matrix
- Consistent experience across devices

### Device Testing Strategy

- Device simulation during development
- Real device testing protocol

## Build & Deployment Configuration

### Development Workflow

- pnpm for efficient package management
- Turbopack for fast development server
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Vercel for automated testing and deployment
- Environment-specific builds
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Automated accessibility checks
- Production deployment with rollback capability
